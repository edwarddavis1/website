        <h2>An Introduction to Graph Embedding</h2>

        <p>You may not realise it, but graphs are everywhere. The neuron interactions in your brain provide you with conscious thought [ref], and protein interactions make up your immune system [ref]. The molecules that you interact with look [ref] and even smell [ref] in a specific way due to the structure of their atomic composition and the language you use to communicate holds meaning due to specific orderings and contexts of words [ref]. While each of these complex systems may seem to exist in wildy different domains, they can all be represented as a graph.</p> 

        <p>Graph embedding gives us a way of representing these large and complex systems in a concise space, allowing us to visualise the structure they hold as well as apply downstream machine learning techniques to learn about how these systems work.</p>

        <h3>Spectral Embedding</h3>
        <p>Spectral embedding is one of the simplest graph embedding techniques, posessing both speed and theoretical tractability.</p>
