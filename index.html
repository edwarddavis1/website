STILL TO FIX

- Nav bar bad at small widths
- need to add social links
- supervisor links
- hide some of the abstract for the paper
- add a high-level summary of paper? (Or maybe just write a blog post about it)

          <h2>Research Outline</h2>
          <p>My work focuses on dynamic network embedding. 

            Dynamic networks encode both spatial and temporal relations between nodes, which are desirable for many applications from cyber security to neuroscience. By representing the nodes of the network as a vector space, it allows us to detect spatial and temporal patterns through clustering.
            
            Methods that I have developed during my PhD have been used by Microsoft and LV, and I have presented these methods at the <a href="https://ima.org.uk/17625/4th-ima-conference-on-the-mathematical-challenges-of-big-data/">Institute of Mathematics Big Data Conference</a> and the <a href="https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/calendar_event/compass-conference/">COMPASS conference</a> in 2022. 
            
            I am interested in progressing dynamic embedding methods and applying them to a diverse range of problems.</p>

                <h3>Universal Stable Dynamic Graph Embedding with Robust
                    Hypothesis Testing</h3>
                <article>
                <p>In this paper we address the problem of dynamic network embedding, that is, representing
                    the nodes of a dynamic network as evolving vectors within a low-dimensional space. These
                    representations must encode the spatio-temporal structure of the network such that it can
                    be extracted through downstream tasks such as clustering. Stable dynamic embeddings
                    ensure that nodes with the same behaviour are always assigned the same spatio-temporal
                    position. We prove that any label-invariant single-graph embedding method can produce a
                    stable dynamic embedding when acting on the general unfolded adjacency matrix. As an
                    example, we demonstrate that an adaptation to the popular node2vec embedding, unfolded
                    node2vec, represents a significant improvement over previous attempts to produce dynamic
                    versions of node2vec. We additionally present a permutation test which can be used to check
                    the significance of changes detected in a dynamic embedding and use it to demonstrate that
                    embedding methods which lack stability fail to correctly recover spatio-temporal structure,
                    even in trivial cases. Finally, we apply these methods to a flight network which tracks
                    connections between airports from January 2019 to December 2021. We find that stable
                    methods can recover both the periodic nature of this network, as well as detecting the
                    correct shape of the two main COVID-19 waves that occurred in Europe.
                    Keywords: dynamic graphs, graph representation learning, hypothesis testing, spatio-
                    temporal clustering.</p>

                    <figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong> The clustering of a flight network embedding, computed with URLSE,
                        considering only European nodes. For reference, we plot the number of European countries
                        with any public transport restrictions in response to COVID-19 over time (Hale et al.,
                        2021). We see that the clusters found in the network embedding closely match the COVID-
                        19 policy changes, which leads us to conclude that the temporal structure recovered by
                        URLSE is correct.

        <p>Dynamic network embedding is a powerful technique for analyzing time-varying networks, but it can be challenging to ensure that the embeddings remain stable over time. In this blog post, we explore the importance of stability in dynamic network embedding and discuss some strategies for achieving it.</p>
