        <h2>PhD Research Outline</h2>
        <p>
          My PhD thesis addresses the problem of how to understand information encoded in
          multi-layer graphs. Here, a graph could refer to a network or a corpus of text,
          and multi-layer could refer to a graph that is dynamic or observed in different
          contexts. We address this problem through the use of <a
            href="https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2022/01/10/student-perspectives-ed-davis/"> graph embedding</a>, a
          process by which we assign each node (or edge, or the whole graph) to a
          vector. This creates a space in which nodes with similar behaviour are closer to
          each other. We invented a<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09251"> new way of embedding dynamic graphs</a>
          by using a framework that extended the
          applicability of any established
          graph embedding method to multi-layer graphs.
          We provide a statistical guarantee that our framework produces multi-layer
          embeddings that are stable over space and time (the first general proof of its
          kind), and we show through rigorous simulated and real-data experiments that
          our framework is more powerful and interpretable than other state-of-the-art
          methods. We have also shown that this framework demonstrates empirical gains when applied to <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230"> Graph Neural Networks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our proof of stability can be rephrased as a proof of exchangeability, that is,
          our embedding framework can take a multi-layer graph and turn it into an
          exchangeable sequence of vectors. With exchangeability, we gain access to
          other fields of maths, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230"> conformal prediction</a> and
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20895">the bootstrap</a>.

        <h2>What is a graph embedding?</h2>
        <p>See the graphic below for a visual explanation of a graph embedding. On the left, we see a Harry Potter
          emnity network (adversarial interactions) plotted in the conventional way. On the right, we see a
          corresponding graph embedding where each node is represented in a 2D space (hover over each node to see the
          correspondence). In this case, the graph embedding is able to separate the good and the bad characters in the
          Harry Potter world.</p>

        <p>My work mainly focuses on how to best compute a dynamic graph embedding. In the below example, a network is
          changing its connections over time. In the corresponding dynamic embedding, we are able to see how this
          structure changes over time - click "Play" to see a dynamic graph embedding in action! To find out more about

        <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230"> Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs (Accepted, ICLR)</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful black-box models which have shown impressive empirical performance.
          However, without any form of uncertainty quantification, it can be difficult to trust such models in high-risk
          scenarios. Conformal prediction aims to address this problem, however, an assumption of exchangeability is
          required for its validity which has limited its applicability to static graphs and transductive regimes.

          We propose to use unfolding, which allows any existing static GNN to output a dynamic graph embedding with
          exchangeability properties. Using this, we extend the validity of conformal prediction to dynamic GNNs in both
          transductive and semi-inductive regimes. We provide a theoretical guarantee of valid conformal prediction in
          these cases and demonstrate the empirical validity, as well as the performance gains, of unfolded GNNs against
          standard GNN architectures on both simulated and real datasets.

        <figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong> UGCN and block diagonal GCN representations of an i.i.d. stochastic block
          model after applying PCA. The models were trained with transductive masks. Block diagonal GCN appears to
          encode a significant change over time despite there being none. The embedding from UGCN is exchangeable over
          time, as would be expected.

        <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09251">A Simple and Powerful Framework for
            Stable Dynamic Network Embedding</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic network embedding, that is, representing the nodes of a
            dynamic network as evolving vectors within a low-dimensional space. While the field of single-graph
            embedding is wide and established, the field of dynamic graph embedding is comparatively in its infancy. In
            this paper, we propose that we can take a wide class of established single-graph embedding methods and use
            them to produce interpretable and powerful dynamic graph embeddings by simply applying them to the dilated
            unfolded matrix. We provide a theoretical guarantee that, regardless of embedding dimension, these
            <i>unfolded</i> methods will produce stable embeddings over time and space, meaning that nodes with
            identical latent behaviour will be exchangeable, regardless of their position in time or space.

        <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20895">Valid Bootstraps for Networks with Applications to Network
            Visualisation</a></h3>
        <article>
          <p>Quantifying uncertainty in networks is an important step in modelling relationships and interactions
            between entities. We consider the challenge of bootstrapping an inhomogeneous random graph when only a
            single observation of the network is made and the underlying data generating function is unknown. We utilise
            an exchangeable network test that can empirically validate bootstrap samples generated by any method, by
            testing if the observed and bootstrapped networks are statistically distinguishable. We find that existing
            methods fail this test. To address this, we propose a principled, novel, distribution-free network bootstrap
            using k-nearest neighbour smoothing, that can regularly pass this exchangeable network test in both
            synthetic and real-data scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of this work in combination with the popular
            data visualisation method t-SNE, where uncertainty estimates from bootstrapping are used to explain whether
            visible structures represent real statistically sound structures.</p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong> An overview of the proposed graph bootstrap framework. Given an adjacency
          matrix (a), we use its network embedding (b) to estimate the probability matrix (c) using k-nearest
          neighbours, from which the adjacency matrix was drawn. From this, we draw many new adjacency matrices (d) and
          use them to estimate the uncertainty in the network embedding (e). We then use this uncertainty to explain the
          visible structures in the network embedding (f).
